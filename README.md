# torch-mlir-scripts

This repository consists of scripts that I have found useful for debugging code in `torch-mlir`. Information on how to use each script can be found in the docstring of each script.

## Running `torch_linalg_mix` example

Build `torch-mlir` from branch [demo-torch-linalg-mix](https://github.com/ramiro050/torch-mlir/tree/demo-torch-linalg-mix) of my `torch-mlir` fork. Then,

```shell
python torch_linalg_mix.py
```
